# The Ping Pong Test Code Review

##### The Ping Pong Test Code Review, written for the Summer 2015 Intro to Programming class, 10/16/2015

#### By Midori Bowen

## Description

This is a webpage where, upon entering a number into a prompt box, the page prints all the numbers with 'ping' replacing multiples of 3, 'pong' replacing multiples of 5, and 'ping-pong' replacing multiples of 3 and 5 (i.e. 15).
This test demonstrates my knowledge of loops, conditions, and variables.

## Setup

* Enter number in prompt box.
* Watch your number get ping-ponged!
* Tried to use an input box initially, but switched to a prompt box for simplicity.
* Also tried to have each conditional print an mp3 link with a 'ping', 'pong', or 'ping-pong' sound attached. I wasn't able to do that, but maybe I can figure it out at another time.

## Technologies Used

* JQuery - uncompressed, development jQuery 1.11.3
* Bootstrap v.3.3.5
* Javascript
